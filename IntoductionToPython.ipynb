    "Python is a simple and easy programming language. It is close to the English language, so it is easy to read and understand. Because of this, Python is a good choice for beginners.\n",

    "Mistakes will happen, and that is completely okay. Every error is part of learning. We will learn by practicing and improving a little every day.\n",

    "If we stay consistent and trust the process, we will complete this journey and reach our target of understanding Python and using it for Machine Learning.\n",
