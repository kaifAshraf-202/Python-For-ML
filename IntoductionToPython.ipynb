    "Python is a simple and easy programming language. It is close to the English language, so it is easy to read and understand. Because of this, Python is a good choice for beginners.\n",

    "At the beginning, we will learn small things like variables, data types, and basic logic. Slowly, we will move towards writing programs and solving real problems.\n",

    "Mistakes will happen, and that is completely okay. Every error is part of learning. We will learn by practicing and improving a little every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we stay consistent and trust the process, we will complete this journey and reach our target of understanding Python and using it for Machine Learning.\n",
